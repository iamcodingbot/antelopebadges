# rollup

This example is to demonstrate a basic EOSIO smart contract, including

- Define contract actions
- Define a table
- Perform read/write/remove operations on the table

This consumer emits assets as soon as the criteria defined in activator_criteria and emitter_criteria is met.

Use cases -
1) emit asset as an account receives a group of assets.
2) create a dag like structure for asset emission.
